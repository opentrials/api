The OpenTrials API service.

## Developer notes

### Requirements

* Node 5.8
* PostgreSQL 9.5
* ElasticSearch 1.5.2

### Installing

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and alter its contents as needed.
   At minimum, you should set the `DATABASE_URL` and `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`. The
   `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is needed to run the tests. You could leave the
   `ELASTICSEARCH_AWS_*` as is if you're not using ElasticSearch on AWS;
2. Run `npm install`;
3. Run `npm run migrate`;
4. (Optional) If you want, you can add some seed data using `npm run seed`;
5. Run `npm run reindex`;

After the install and migrations ran successfully, you can run `npm run dev` to
run the project. If you haven't changed the default `PORT`, it should be
available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Reindexing

Currently, there's no way to automatically reindex the data. Every time you
change the database, you'd need to run `npm run reindex` to keep ElasticSearch
in sync.

### Testing

You can run the test suite and linting with `npm test`.
